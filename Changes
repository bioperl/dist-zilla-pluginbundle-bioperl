Summary of important user-visible changes for dist-zilla-pluginbundle-Bioperl
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

{{$NEXT}}
  * Replace use of deprecated [EOLTests] with [Test::EOL]
  * Replace use of bugtracker.web from [MetaResources] with bugtracker.github
    from [AutoMetaResources].  Note that [MetaResources] was not expand
    %{dist} on bugtracker.web and therefore previous versions had incorrect
    links to the bugtracker.
  * Removed use of Authority plugin as it is now obsolete in perl5.
  * Removed [RunExtraTests].  Use `dzil test -all'.  See also `dzil smoke'.

0.23      2014-09-05 09:46:02-05:00 America/Chicago

0.21      2014-08-28 09:14:19-05:00 America/Chicago
  * Updated list of dependencies (plugins from the BioPerl bundle which
    are implicit dependencies).
  * Add roles to remove unwanted plugins if requested.
  * Add proper dependencies if they are picked up, and bootstrap.
  * Redirect URL to MetaCPAN instead of search.cpan.org.

0.20      2013-04-02 06:09:17 Europe/Dublin
  * The default authority for the distribution is now cpan:BIOPERLML.
  * Included the [MojibakeTests] plugin to check for correct encoding.
  * The Git will commit changes to the Changes and dist.ini file as part of the
    release, and the created tag mentions the distribution name.
  * Created a new Pod::Weaver plugin bundle for BioPerl which is used as default
    by Bioperl's Dist::Zilla pluginbundle.
  * [Readme] is now filtered from [@Basic] since most bioperl distributions
    already have a README or README.md file and if teh first already exists, it
    conflicts with [Readme].
  * Removed the option disable_pod_coverage_tests. The use of [@Filter]
    is recommended instead.
  * Removed disable_trailing_whitespace_tests. Set `trailing_whitespace = 0`
  * Removed the repository, repository_type, repository_web, github_user,
    repository_at, and homepage_url options. Replaced with github.user and
    homepage from the [AutoMetaResources] plugin.
  * Removed the bugtracker_email and bugtracker_url. Replaced by [MetaResources]
    bugtracker.mailto and bugtracker.web
  * Include [Git::Check] and [Git::Commit].
  * Option dist is no longer required.
  * Fix default bugtracker.email and bugtracker.web values.
